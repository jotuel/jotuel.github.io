Hive is built on the 42 peer-to-peer learning methods. So I in fact also am a "teacher" at the school. And I do have already loads of hands on experience solving together an issue that someone is facing with their approach to writing a certain functions or a program.

Only because in the traditional sense of 1-to-many style lectures or teaching this would not seem comparable, because normally there are only two persons present, even though sometimes a small group can gather up. Also because I am not always an expert on the thing that is being solved. In fact often am just learning it myself. Many times something simple, other than the whole logic, needs to be fixed and you encounter a new approach.
