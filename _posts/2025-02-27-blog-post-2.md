Time seems to move fast when you have things going on. The start to the year has not gone all smoothly and according to plan.
Still it is kind of an amazing thing to notice how stuff that earlier seemed impossible, now is just hard. Yet it seems that this pace of progress still is not as much as expected.
But already regression is rearing its head. Stuff that seemed clear cut, like conditional statements, need to be every time relearned.

On the other hand stuff like forks, threads, sh & signals all seem approachable. Mixed bag, really. In other news finally starting to grasp 
the chinese curse "may you live in interesting times." That is certainly a valid experience right now.
