An alumni of Hive said to me last year that only hardcore people can do those studies and work at the same time. I only kinda did, but lets put it like this: you won't have any extra time left to maintain a personal blog for example. Now I've graduated.

Yet I don't really consider myself hc, more like extremely lucky. I got great partners in team projects and so what I was able to bring was enough. Easy, it was not, and that is also why I'd say you just need to be able to bend: as things like that wont break.

Of course it is looking more than likely that I've had to sacrifice my allotment plot to chase another dream but everyone makes sacrifices. And I feel so fortunate sometimes that letting something go just yields even better things.

Here goes hoping, lets wish for a great year 2026, the early signs haven't looked great but you never know.
