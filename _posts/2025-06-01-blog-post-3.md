Time is flyin' by. A little over half of school completed. But this one keeps going all summer and the only thing "slowing me down" is gardening at my allotment plot.

Cpp, or OOP, is upon us. Lucky for me I've already completed two courses at the Open University that were all about it. Also by fall we should've built a basic raytracer.

This year I planted: 
 * cucumber 
 * pumpkin
 * dill
 * carrots

So with the normal berries it should be a decent harvest. Well better go soak them in water as the sun is shining.
