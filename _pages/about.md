Hi. You reached me, Joonas. 
[Hive](https://hive.fi) alumni and [Seure](https://seure.fi) gig worker located in Helsinki.

Right now actively seeking an internship position.

I'm hoping to further extend my software engineering knowledge.

On my free time I play floorball with Eiran Vesa, build & maintain stuff that I or others need and do my best to garden (I kill a lot of plants. :))

Feel free to contact me.
