[Hive](https://hive.fi) alumni and [Seure](https://seure.fi) gig worker. 

Located in Helsinki.

Right now actively seeking an internship position.

I'm hoping to further extend my software engineering knowledge.

On my free time I play floorball with Eiran Vesa, build & maintain stuff that I or others need and do my best to garden (I kill a lot of plants. 😅)

Currently working on finishing my fingerprint scan management application and in early planning phases of a matrix client for the same desktop environment.

Feel free to contact me. 📧
